# Recommender-Systems
These are systems aim to predict user’s interest and recommend items that are interesting to them, most e-commerce and retail implementing 
recommender system on their system to boosting sales

Advantages of implanting recommender systems:
*	Focus of Increasing sales for the companies
*	Speed up searches and make it easier for user to access content fast that they are interested in
*	Companies are able to increase number of customers by sending out emails with link to new offers that meets the user’s interests
*	Moreover, allow company to be position ahead of competitors

Types of recommender systems
*	Content-based which uses characteristics information
*	Collaborative filtering which is based on user-item interactions
*	Hybrid system combine both type of information

**Content-based system**: these systems make recommendation using users’ item and profile features

  Common problem arises in this kind of recommender system

* New users lack a defined profile unless they are explicitly asked for information
* System are not able to recommend items outside the categories that are assigned to a specific user, even though user could be interesting to them

 Advantages:

* It is relatively to add new items to the system

**Collaborative filtering**: they aim to predict new interactions based on historical ones

There are two types of method to archives this goal:

 * Memory-based
 * Model-based

There are two main challenges come up with collaborative filtering:

*	We cannot give recommendations to users until have interacted with a significant number of items
*	We have no prior information about user since they don’t have existing interactions with the system.

Collaborative filtering is currently one of the most frequently used approach and usually provides better results than content-based recommendations
